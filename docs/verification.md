# Verifier CLI — otel-agent-audit-verify

`otel-agent-audit-verify` reads an audit log and checkpoint file produced by
`agentauditexporter` and verifies:

1. **Per-trace Ed25519 signatures** — every log entry's signature and entry hash.
2. **Hash chain continuity** — each entry links to the previous via `entry_hash`.
3. **Checkpoint coverage** — each checkpoint's signature and `prev_checkpoint_hash`
   chain; cross-checks `tip_hash` and `entry_count` against the log.

## Build

```bash
cd exporter/agentauditexporter
go build -o ../../dist/otel-agent-audit-verify ./cmd/otel-agent-audit-verify
```

## Usage

```
otel-agent-audit-verify [-key <hex>] [-key-file <pem>] [-json] <log-file> <checkpoint-file>
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-key <hex>` | Hex-encoded Ed25519 public key (64 hex chars = 32 bytes) |
| `-key-file <pem>` | Path to PEM file with `PUBLIC KEY` block (PKIX/SubjectPublicKeyInfo) |
| `-json` | Emit results as JSON (`{"TracesVerified":…,"CheckpointsVerified":…,"Errors":[…]}`) |

Exactly one of `-key` or `-key-file` is required; using both is an error.

## Getting the public key

The collector is configured with a PEM private key (`key_path` in the exporter
config). Extract the corresponding public key with OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl pkey -in /path/to/private.pem -pubout -out /path/to/public.pem
```

Then pass `-key-file /path/to/public.pem` to the verifier.

To get the raw hex bytes for use with `-key`:

```bash
openssl pkey -in /path/to/private.pem -pubout -outform DER | tail -c 32 | xxd -p -c 32
```

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | All checks pass |
| 1 | One or more verification failures (see output for details) |
| 2 | Usage error, I/O error, or key parse error |

## Example output (human-readable)

```
Traces verified:      42
Checkpoints verified: 1
Status: OK
```

Failure example:

```
Traces verified:      42
Checkpoints verified: 1
Status: FAILED (1 error(s))
  [0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef] chain: seq 2: signature verification failed
```

## JSON output (`-json`)

```json
{
  "TracesVerified": 42,
  "CheckpointsVerified": 1,
  "Errors": []
}
```

`Errors` is a JSON array of objects: `{"TraceID": "…", "Kind": "…", "Detail": "…"}`.
`TraceID` is empty for checkpoint-level errors.

## Audit policy

- Traces not covered by any checkpoint are counted but not flagged as errors
  (the last batch before a crash may have been written before the final checkpoint).
- A missing log or checkpoint file is treated as empty — no error is returned.
- Partial or corrupt final lines left by a crash are silently skipped.

## Key distribution (v1 scope)

Key distribution is the operator's responsibility. Recommended practices:

- Store the public key alongside the audit log (e.g. `audit.pub.pem`).
- Include the `key_id` field from the log entries in any chain-of-custody record
  so verifiers can confirm they are using the correct key for a given epoch.
- Key rotation is not defined for v1; after rotation, entries carry the new
  `key_id`. Run the verifier once per epoch, each time with the key that matches
  that epoch's `key_id`.
